1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,240
this is the grand final of the na ti 11

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,120
regional qualifiers nouns versus sonics

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,680
in no position to do anything yep jump

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
on straight on top toss them back and

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
yahweh he's gonna move back but you are

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
is getting that first one and omni

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,599
knight is scanning out those sacks here

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,119
should know where he is yes he's going

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,800
to show himself but his reinforcements

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
are coming in quick z3 gonna show the

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,920
smoke doubles gonna come in and maybe

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,440
the punch man make sure he dies he does

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,879
jump off but he might be able to get

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
safety he's got enough movement here

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,280
between him and in husky and he'd even

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
got it too but the shards are beautiful

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
from the task and the punch through the

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,520
moon he is gone mss sun from sea freak

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,039
under control between three he is just

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,960
gonna take some punishment that's gonna

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,199
wait for his chance to secure that kill

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
a double kill for nancy quinn isn't

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,879
showing on the map has lasso up so oh

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,040
that rider doesn't see the gyrocopter we

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,240
do actually have some rainfall the

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,159
gunner is here but we're gonna try and

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,680
pull away and get him on high ground but

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,159
no it is quinstock dead stand on up and

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,720
if gunner can find him yes he can but

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
can the snowball connect no he has

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,680
shards on the high ground he's gonna

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,439
block but a firefight is done so he just

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
needs to be able to land it just to kill

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
this kill ghana charging forward has

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
another snowball two more seconds but

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
the movement is gonna be there and move

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
actually fighting through the bottom

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
line and getting a double kill for

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,159
himself while quinn is just fighting

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
with gunner who's trapping of constantly

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,680
husky even coming in to help on out but

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
his background is just so evasive so

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,079
slippery that he's able to almost make

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
it back to us and potentially turn for

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
his own kill oh father can't capitalize

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
quinn's got nothing left in the tank but

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
i think maybe move on wayne

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
he is actually gonna get caught pull

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
back in secret response is gonna be

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
fierce but not quick enough to get any

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,960
kills or save moo and now husky okay

56
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,799
then left him by himself now he's the

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,320
one who tp first so he gets left last

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
mcqueen on a killing spree but it was

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
gone tower goes to but mid tier one it's

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,560
getting fresh and they're bringing

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,239
everybody back maybe just jump forward

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,840
and find somebody no

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
they know something's happening bottom

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
there's no point gonna neglect so you

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,959
can't believe back home you have to

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,920
really

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
get quinn to do the work for you

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
is in this room it's halfway done gunner

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,520
is still in town range playing as safe

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
as possible but twin comes in pulls back

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
in right back comes out black hole might

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,040
be used yep just to make sure he doesn't

73
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
pull back in husky so he can't get him

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
but he does and ghana survives oh man

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
that's a disaster for snakes they're

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,000
just gonna run out but they are losing

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
all their chances too as quinn as well

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
has to bail at this point slow everybody

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
down because he notices the swap and z3

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
gonna pull back in that bkb would have

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
been vital right now but you can't beat

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,200
spell moon at all from all the damage

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
output right now from nouns because they

84
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
are just running down sq

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,959
fada can't jump off anyone he's got no

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,280
friends around him as gunner is just

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
gonna work him in the back they've got

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,239
the creep finally there's shards a

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,519
little bit off the mark there but you've

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
got the chuck from the find him and

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,840
you've got a triple

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
dude

93
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
nobody's going too far forward

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
everyone's playing safe and doing what

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,519
they need to the only one making real

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,360
moves here is queen pushing out these

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,800
ways here msf okay your entire smoke got

98
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,480
you two or two down the top and one

99
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,840
kilometer that's not too bad

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,159
your tuscans spoke off it they've seen

101
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
it they won't probably capitalize onto

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,519
it just gonna try and bait out an

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,599
illusion maybe get one lasso onto

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,519
illusion maybe move has a lot of swords

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
already popped off is waiting for his

106
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
own moment to jump up again the load is

107
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,640

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
three they need to burn down the big

112
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,200

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,000
think target they want they got the

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,199
punch they're going to run back gunner

173
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,560
is going to punch off any control you've

174
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
got but he will get picked up with

175
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,039
darkness and in zafada

176
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
start combination out but he's low to

177
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
solve his invasion

178
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
both these teams are playing so fast and

179
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
so hard right now number one to move

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,080
much from back with the hill will come

181
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
down and see frick even getting the swap

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
giving up his own life double sun comes

183
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,639
out gonna be trying to run from this but

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
i do not think the bench can run as bad

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
will jump on top although he comes out

186
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
but he is just more time for his team to

187
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
escape

188
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
let's see everybody visually gonna get

189
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
caught gonna be running away they can

190
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,680
see the entire team come across because

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
division renowned catches them two queen

192
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
he's gonna burn then get a good position

193
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,759
here but he can't actually get the last

194
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,120
one to anybody ever the duty route on

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
the looter means you just evacuate z

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
freak again man to get his own life up

197
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
this time not intentionally and he gets

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,639
caught right finally swapped on in and

199
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
moved by the black hole final gyrocopter

200
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,560
with the eclipse on top they need all

201
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
the damage you get but the bkb is doing

202
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
so much work right now satanic is there

203
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
but it's a double black hole back onto

204
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,440
three they all came in to help him out

205
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,840
but they all go down the same way

206
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,039
sonix an absolutely brutal fight as your

207
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,000
wild the dd rune entering your base is

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
ready to take it all away

209
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
you are

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
i think this game's done game one

211
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
was was a bang 18k gold lead at this

212
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
point as ghana gonna get caught gonna

213
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
get snowballed into the team and just

214
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
stun him up into oblivion and he is

215
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
always gone but it doesn't really matter

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,240
as the game is gone as game one of the

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,880
best of five rational qualifiers go

218
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
straight to snakes but they're on the

219
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,639
vision do they know they're on the

220
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,000
vision

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
that's the question because i don't

222
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
think they know they're on the vision

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,879
all right what's going to play sound

224
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,759
they're going to actually get the water

225
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,039
out of it partisan is ready to jump on

226
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,639
mss i don't think you want to get

227
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,319
leveled on dive

228
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,840
no you don't you've already put the

229
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
points in the birds and the bird goes

230
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
down to give the first spot straight to

231
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
nouns here mo try and take him out of

232
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
father and you are doing that thing

233
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,879
glass back when you are though everyone

234
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,080
getting very low the armor is coming in

235
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,319
but you are is gonna drop first fighter

236
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
does get the kill the game for moot is

237
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
gone but moo takes the pa with him which

238
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,319
is not the trade they're looking to make

239
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,919
queen needs to dive pretty deep to get

240
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,680
this one actually gonna be tournament ms

241
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,319
beautiful pull in from ghana but he's

242
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,960
got the lasso anyway paul's on back and

243
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,479
we're past he's going to keep the back

244
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,039
rider back instead of the storm spirit

245
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,039
so storm dies

246
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,360
batman gets out anyway

247
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
oh no and because he made the tp

248
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,640
mars just almost echoes slammed

249
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,760
into the ground no jump on board z freak

250
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,320
he gets out you get fish comes in gun

251
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
goes straight for the master get the

252
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
easiest kills first we've got it but

253
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
mars is here with arena enhanced fear

254
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
then in the versace pinning him to the

255
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
wall and he's going to see three just

256
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
trying to get the tp out and he's like

257
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
yeah okay cool i survived

258
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
gonna come back in bishop going straight

259
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,040
for quinn i'm gonna bring the pale but

260
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
the fish is a little bit off in here

261
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
jump over it and gunner is gonna be a

262
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
little bit short but we can get him on

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,519
that foot sign and we're gonna pull back

264
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
in excellent being used and that rudder

265
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
is gone deleted out of this game that's

266
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,279
much better

267
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
nothing

268
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
because he's gone for lame presence

269
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,800
built not fighting bill oh emma says

270
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,560
burning down this massage pinning him

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
down just gonna get the egg and try and

272
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,920
pop him he's doing it pretty well but

273
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
quinn somehow shows up it's called boots

274
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,920
travel and you can't crack that egg but

275
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,760
they can crack moo husky gone too double

276
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
kill for this bat rider

277
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
oh give him a chance he's just hit he's

278
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,399
just hit level seven

279
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
jump on forward we don't do the arena

280
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
for this my friend we've got here

281
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
being you toss them back in and he's

282
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,200
gone z freak with a fisher could

283
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
you could see it in his eyes like if i

284
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
had a blink i could echo slam that but

285
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,080
they're just losing birth they might be

286
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,640
losing a marcy who can just jump away to

287
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
safety too this mastery heroes got their

288
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
broken

289
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
the lord version counters out jump in

290
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
there husky is there to save him but the

291
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
arena's gonna came back so there's no

292
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,240
spells for you no disruption unless you

293
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,920
call yourself but he's still trapped in

294
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
the arena so what does that disruption

295
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,839
even do fisher comes out tries to break

296
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
him up husky is gone storm for it tp

297
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
dawn in but

298
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,480
nothing can come of this it is just a

299
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
slaughter here that's some gold back

300
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
into your pockets that's some more space

301
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,959
for you that's a yash kill for the pl

302
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
and his tipping point gets a little bit

303
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,200
closer

304
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
little fighters

305
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
getting ready to go in quinn is back

306
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,360
from the base full hp full mana gunner

307
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
not the same thing half mana in his

308
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
pocket could zip a little bit of

309
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
distance but can't zip too far but they

310
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
just want to slow down his push maybe

311
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,839
get an eye out of it but that's a lot of

312
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,120
work to get a tier one tower in the

313
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
arcane room okay firefly comes out but

314
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,120
he's being disrupted he needs to be

315
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
controlled fisher comes out gonna go to

316
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,040
the chalkboard

317
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,079
careful where he goes smoke is coming in

318
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
mars is looking for jump same with the

319
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
bat rider here but

320
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
they've got smoke on smoke action husky

321
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,079
haven't broken his smoke but ghana goes

322
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,200
in pulling back in the mass keep the

323
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
marine away from the egg has been popped

324
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,920
they needed this connection a moment

325
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,279
after looking right the adx left has

326
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,320
been used for the beginning they're

327
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
popped around it so it does no damage

328
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,120
moving back trying to get out as he is

329
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,079
actually going to be doing a little bit

330
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
damage in the river but you are even

331
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,519
finds him in the back jump and burning

332
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,800
every single thing they've got as the

333
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,959
massage can't get back into action as

334
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,800
quinn is so low and the illusion's doing

335
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,640
their job and now constabilo he's going

336
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,839
to try and get a kill with him but he's

337
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,560
gone out of it so he got the bat but

338
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,760
everyone else does so much damage to to

339
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
doing kind of what

340
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,519

341
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,440

bottom on the high ground we'll actually

344
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
see everybody toss it back in but it's

345
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,360
that beautiful arena move it's up to all

346
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,959

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,079
able to be a little bit suffering but

359
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,720

360
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
the

361
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
tank for nouns

365
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
storm spirit is invis breaking any

366
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,040
smokes you can see

367
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,360
and they can see where quinn is but they

368
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
can't see where the pas can't even

369
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
masters can't see where father is so to

370
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,720

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,600
himself mars pops his big heavy and just

374
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200

375
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,480
donna gets scared and runs away mo oh

376
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240

378
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,240
they are just running everyone down

379
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
there is nothing they can do it seems

380
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,600
he's going right back because they need

381
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
it

382
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920

383
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
this has an ogre axe that is casually

384

hanging out roche isn't up yet that's 10

385
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,720
seconds away i think both teams know

386
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,279
what quinn is on the cliff here scanning

387
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,240
out anyone who may be on the lower

388
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,079
ground speaker which we've got the

389
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,639
entire team announced smoke is broken

390
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,760
gonna see him on the high drag queen

391
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
goes in just get some lasso straight on

392
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,959
the z3 but the trucks are going to save

393
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
masks arena around everyone and husky is

394
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
gone but he saves the freak maybe for

395
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
the extra slam of the game he gets off

396
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,440
for the vkb he's gonna be popped

397
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,800
instantly around at five jumps in the

398
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,079
egg is gonna be popping up so much to

399
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,000
spray they do lose fire but they're not

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
losing anybody else because everyone

401
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
else has to run got gunners got some

402
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,800
more mana quinn being surrounded by the

403
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
illusions it's gone

404
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,680
but move he's getting chipped up by mars

405
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
and the phoenix here but you are able to

406
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,079
clean them up three gone two in response

407
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,470
and roche is opened up

408
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,120
[Music]

409
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,680
like what part of values the most

410
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,560
don't

411
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
please don't do this because feeling

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,800
don't do it please see frank's gone dead

413
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,399
get out of here

414
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,839
that's why you shouldn't have done that

415
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,800
but

416
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,160
maybe take a chance

417
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,399
maybe get a jump in four seconds okay

418
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,959
that range into the arena but the manta

419
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
dodge of the spear a beautiful play for

420
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
pl but i do not think it saves his life

421
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,160
talked back in killed anyway but that

422
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
manta was awesome

423
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
oh it's just the abyssal blade here

424
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
we're lane

425
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,040
just gonna be dead because who doesn't

426
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,920
want a 300 gold miles jumps in gets the

427
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
arena and we've already pulled back and

428
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
see things and no echo slams this fight

429
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
pa just work the building about the work

430
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
move he comes back out of his rock form

431
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,440
and he's gone gunner coming back in to

432
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,519
pull back in mars 27 have the act at

433
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,040
zebra buying back gets a beautiful fish

434
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
of the eggs that came back but pl has

435
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
been caught again

436
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,000
back to safety no more continue never

437
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
falling through yet as pl is actually

438
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,720
looking to fight but he can't find his

439
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,199
angle yet

440
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,120
interesting

441
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
i i guess you can't rely on

442
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,399
oh don't worry about it because we're

443
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,279
about to get the smoke

444
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,920
nouns need this smoke to go well they

445
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
need to find somebody they need to find

446
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
somebody big while quinn isn't actually

447
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,560
there at the fight father is in viz

448
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
and can scout out and potentially can

449
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
break any smoke that may go for them but

450
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,600
for now nouns are playing it super

451
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
saiyan

452
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
wins already back

453
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
that pinged out mid they know where they

454
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,959
are they've got some fish in firefox bkb

455
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,320
and ready to go on there and emphasis is

456
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,560
flying on through his gun but move he's

457
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
being found out again pulled back in and

458
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
maybe this time he has some hope because

459
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,959
this team isn't leaving him hanging the

460
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,040
rock is done ghana goes in finds himself

461
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,399
in backline pulling back in but i need

462
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,600
more damage to come for the edge

463
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,360
actually comes off coming his course it

464
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
goes down the arena is around him and

465
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,959
just

466
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,440
his shrine to announce team fight here

467
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
because it is going bad moves gone same

468
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,079
with pl surrounded by everyone gunner

469
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,440
flying back and getting ready to join

470
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
fighting maybe he hasn't zipped in yet

471
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,639
because everybody is dead so two

472
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,680
buybacks earn them nothing cut the wave

473
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,360
and they lose the fight 42 12 a 44k gold

474
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,000
lead between the two teams and this just

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,120
might be game two

476
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,920
got catapults one man

477
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,680
they kept this game going for 42 minutes

478
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,959
our cameroon that i know someone's going

479
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,440
to go for and fighter oh okay

480
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
and it's on the fingers there but into

481
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
the arena could be finding up zebra keys

482
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,599
as we bounce away another one husky is

483
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,919
gonna actually get caught slow them down

484
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,959
but gunner is trying to save his shadow

485
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,760
demon instead he dies no zips away and

486
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,880
dies from the which way gg is gold as

487
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
game two going the way of snakes and is

488
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,039
best to find for the ti-11 north

489
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
american regional qualifiers if snakes

490
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
can take this game out

491
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,720
these guys are going to t.i nouns need

492
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
this game to desperately stay back in

493
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,799
this is hiding the truth we're going to

494
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,799
jump forward get onto the spec tops him

495
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,559
back on in and do we have enough control

496
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
damage i think we do first blood is

497
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,520
going straight to sunny

498
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
yes emma says able to get foot it was it

499
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,280
was too wide if you had like more very

500
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
fires maybe you could survive but it's

501
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,039
looking like a double kill at this point

502
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,559
as mss jumps again and sets it up but

503
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,760
they really just want to keep level 6

504
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,240
away from ghana he's so close he's so

505
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,679
close oh just set up into the lsa he's

506
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,320
got no hope

507
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,579
[Music]

508
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,440
would have been handy too but it's been

509
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,039
given straight to the leaner ms has

510
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,200
become it's tv lsa needs more mana for

511
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,360
some more spells but you're just gonna

512
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
continue to punish up the atmosphere

513
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
speaking of punishment maybe father

514
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,919
deserves a little bit himself he's not

515
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,320
playing too much work being way too

516
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,559
greedy and aggressive on a cm and they

517
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,240
want to give it to move but they're

518
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
going to take it on husky

519
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,400
enigma mid lane knows there's a fight

520
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,559
they've got behind him and twin is still

521
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,480
in the river if they want to capitalize

522
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
on it but we got a bounty strike onto

523
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
ghana more frost shields coming in handy

524
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,160
and said the only way he can sustain in

525
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
lane at this point the punishment is

526
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,960
so hard

527
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
as they're not done

528
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
they're smoking around them they just

529
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
want to set the lsa up they just seem to

530
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,480
cross parts to do it you've got to sort

531
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,840
of pistol and he's got revenues back

532
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,720
into the safe place but it's also a bait

533
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
that's going to be like it's going to be

534
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
found too ever since let's get this done

535
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
just jump on top and with the melon

536
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
pistol you don't need black hole why not

537
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
you've got it so you drop it down and

538
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,160
you drop the specter with it kill on the

539
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
photo to position five cm moves gonna be

540
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,480
diving in same insulin keeping

541
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,559
forcing him to go back and quinn is here

542
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,160
with no mana though and actually

543
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,559
chambered creeps that's real awkward

544
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
i'll say being baited it's the only

545
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
problem he has but he doesn't have 21

546
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,679
charges if he wants to use them all back

547
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
in his team stolen freezing field it is

548
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
so much bad damage but the lsa instantly

549
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
from twins chances at jail straight away

550
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,840
and jump in from msf that wu cox

551
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,520
black hole instantly cancelled and

552
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,640
they're moving back for the brittany

553
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
what's the type of glitch and maybe

554
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,600
losing something on the other side but

555
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,400
quinn is gone that's all you care about

556
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,799
as constability is picking up kills but

557
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,840
emesis is cleaning them back up

558
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,200
going straight for timber timbertrone

559
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
fan away but ghana is slowed down with

560
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,640
all these glass coming out and seeing

561
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
but the chains gonna be keeping this

562
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,960
monkey in place in the middle of the

563
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,679
chatroom and just destroyed as nouns

564
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,760
them got four they got a killing spree

565
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,480
on the timber saw as the father might

566
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
just give them the team wipe as he's

567
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
slowing this timber down trying to bait

568
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
out these chains by getting hit by the

569
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
chuck room instead as he's in the lower

570
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,799
ground blasted away and mo picks it up a

571
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,320
team wipe for nouns

572
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,880
round two seems like we're coming in

573
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,720
move is gonna be starting it but we've

574
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,840
got deep on the creeps and we've got a

575
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
control coming out of the move right now

576
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,559
maybe we still have somebody

577
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,240
just the same because it kills everybody

578
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,360
but that stolen chain frost no

579
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,320
frost the real jane frost destroys

580
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,919
everyone husky out of nowhere pops his

581
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,559
old and pops away both supports on

582
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,120
snakes

583
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,400
looks like we're diving

584
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,080
control you've got and he's dead for he

585
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
can do anything else as kind of goes in

586
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,799
but gunner gets caught and full down and

587
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,120
the midnight pulse just kills him

588
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,080
quinn

589
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
just zoning everybody back supports our

590
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,360
goal on the right clicks are insane

591
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,840
because he's got a dd to boot

592
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,159
and now the slow timber saw

593
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,159
just actually died because of it

594
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,039
physical damage be damned your armor

595
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,280
means nothing when the entire team is

596
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,600
breaking you down and straight

597
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,960
into roche out of it so if they jump on

598
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
him father's gonna be like hey guys what

599
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,440
up father hanging in this long wind goes

600
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,960
into the river they find it break smoke

601
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,640
around and pull down gunner and pop

602
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
everything on to him but husky then he

603
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
saves the combo from going out and now

604
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,080
it's just mss that dies

605
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,480
instead but they want to bait out the

606
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,360
leaner say lean up okay shows up top

607
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,480
does this win just walks in invis

608
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
doesn't even care centuries are just

609
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,640
surrounding him so i get come on i know

610
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,799

611
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,280

all right haunted time titty smoke ready

615
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,039
to go but i think

616
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,240
we're in a good position if we want to

617
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,520
take the fight for nouns because they

618
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,640
are all together moo in smoke breaking

619
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,039
position and he finds actually fighting

620
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,559
smoke gonna be breaking picking out they

621
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
could see where he is thinking the

622
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,720
being placed down but be very careful

623
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,159
he's got friends

624
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,600
who's still on the lower ground boom to

625
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,880
the higher ground can be seen well

626
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
leaner is queen moving in two same

627
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,840
things that's ready to get this timber

628
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,400
still but it is timber he's designed to

629
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,559
tank the woocommerce is way too much to

630
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,679
handle the freeze-filled already been

631
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,280

if godzilla freaks they've broken gunner

634
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,600
gunner goes in finds mss and dies same

635
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,240
with husky and constability who was

636
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
looking to get a good angle into this

637
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,919
fight can't do a thing they're chasing

638
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,640
they're waiting they're dodging lsas you

639
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,400

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,200
and lose their hope for staying in this

644
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,559
fight the bkb is about to run out from

645
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,679

timber and gun is just trying to walk

648
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,919

and doesn't have the same escape

658
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,640
capacities

659
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,320

he will be pulling back in this month

661
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
king is still rooted in the middle of

662
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,559
the shotgun rubric is going to be able

663
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,559
to pick them up and now but memphis is

664
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,760

665
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,320
brutal just chill into the bone as he

666
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
takes out three

667
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
gets double tipped and just destroys the

668
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,159
hope for them to defend this push right

669
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,799
now because there's a dd room cleaner

670
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,520
who wasn't even needed for this

671

truck jumps in you want comes in emesis

672

675
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,760

676
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,279
qualifiers they need to win this game

677
